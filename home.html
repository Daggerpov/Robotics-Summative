                <h1>Daniel Agapov's Robotics Summative Website</h1>
                <p>This is how I'll be presenting my robotics summative write-up for the 2020 First Robotics Competition season, which is in the form of this website I've made with HTML5 and CSS3. The website is compatible on mobile and on laptop/desktop computers.</p>

                <p>From the start of the season until around the end of February, Hassan and I had been 
                    working on the robot's drivetrain code together. Then, as Sayf started working on 
                    a website to automate scouting for FRC, I decided to join in on that. Since, we did not have 
                    a set due date or needed it to be completed for a certain competition this year, I had time 
                    to properly start learning about web development. So, Sayf decided it was best to just have 
                    me learn about the tools he was planning to use for building that website, which, as of right 
                    now, is to be called "RavenScout". The tools being:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flask, a micro web framework written in Python<br><br><img src="./img/flask-logo.png" alt="flask" style="height:100px;"</li><br><br>
                    <li>Python for back-end<br><br><img src="./img/pythonpython.png" alt="python" style="height:100px;"</li><br><br>
                    <li>HTML5, a bit of CSS3, and some JavaScript for front-end<br><br><img src="./img/front-end-logos.png" alt="front end logos" style="height:100px;"</li><br>
                </ul>
                <p>On top of just learning the different tools he wanted me to use for the website, it also required
                    for me to learn about databases and other programming concepts. All of this information was found in
                    the guide he sent, which you can find here: <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">The Flask Mega-Tutorial</a>
                </p>
                <p>I found this assignment challenging and very useful towards my software engineering career. It allowed
                    me to explore different areas of software engineering/development that opened my eyes to new opportunities 
                    and technologies. Previously, I found myself to only be interested in back-end development. However,
                    after learning more about building the front-end of websites, I discovered that it could also be interesting for me 
                    to work on full-stack development.
