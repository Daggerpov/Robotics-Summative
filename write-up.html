                    <p>
                        For my summative write-up for the year 2020, I'll be going over 
                        the material in <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world"
                        >The Flask Mega-Tutorial</a>(Chapters 1-8). To follow along and understand what's happening, a bit of previous 
                        OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) knowledge is recommended, as well as, what I'd classify as an 'intermediate' 
                        understanding of the Python and HTML5 programming languages. However, for things unique to building a dynamic website, you're 
                        hopefully going to find everything you need right here in this write-up.

                    <h3><u>Installing Python</u></h3>
                    <p>Firstly, you need to ensure that <i><b>Python</b></i> is installed onto your machine.
                        This can be done by visiting the <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a> website.
                        Make sure to have it be at least Python3.6 or later, since older versions
                        aren't supported by Flask. Also, make sure that you select "add to PATH" upon 
                        installation. By installing Python, you also get pip, which will allow you to 
                        install packages/libraries directly from whatever terminal window you're using.
                        You can also use your terminal window to check if python is installed by typing 
                        in "python3", or "python" if that doesn't work. This'll display your current version
                        and enter you into the Python Interpreter, which will be used later for various
                        python commands, so remember how to access it.
                        <br><br><img src="./img/python into terminal.jpg">
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3><u>Installing flask</u></h3>
                    <p>Once Python is installed, along with pip, you can then use the command below to install packages(like <b><i>Flask</i></b>).
                        <br><br><img src="./img/pip install package.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>If you're having issues with running this command later on, check to see if you are on 
                        the administrator's account, since it won't work on any other user's account.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to take care of issues such as having to maintain different versions of packages 
                        for different applications, Python uses the concept of <i><b>virtual environments</b></i>.
                        It's essentially a copy of the python interpreter. If you install a package into this virtual 
                        environment, it'll remain local and not affect the rest of 
                        your system. Also, another huge benefit to having a virtual environment setup in your 
                        folder("microblog"), is the portability of your project to other users/computers. Lets say, 
                        if you wanted to put all this code inside of a GitHub repository, like I did when first 
                        making this website with Hassan, you'll be able to clone the repository, along with the venv. 
                        This means that you won't have to go through the process of installing every single package and 
                        such on every single device, but instead, they're ready to go inside of the venv folder. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Yet another benefit to virtual environments, is that they are actually owned by the user that created 
                        them. Which means, that if you faced the issue earlier of not being the administrator on 
                        your computer, you can run commands in here freely. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The first step to this is making a directory to have this virtual environment in.
                        <br><br><img src="./img/mkdir microblog.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Then, you need to enter into the directory you've just made.
                        <br><br><img src="img/cd microblog.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, you can make a new virtual environment, that'll be named "venv". The first word "venv"
                        is for the Python virtual environment package, while the second "venv" is for your 
                        virtual environment's name, which you can change if you'd like.
                        <br><br><img src="./img/python3 -m venv venv.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Note that in some operating systems you may need to use "python" instead of "python3" in
                        the command above, since some installations use "python" for Python2.x releases and "python3" for the 3.x
                        releases, while others simply use "python" for the 3.x releases.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you have your virtual environment created, you need to tell your system that you wish to use it. 
                        To activate your virtual environment you need to type this command on a UNIX(Mac or Linux) system:
                        <br><br><img src="./img/unix activation of venv.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are using the Microsoft Windows command prompt window(like I am), the activation command is slightly different:
                        <br><br><img src="./img/windows activation.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Once in your virtual environment, you can then use the "pip install (package-name)" command from 
                        earlier to install flask.
                        <br><br><img src="./img/pip install flask.jpg">
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3><u>A "Hello, World" Flask Application</u></h3>
                    <p>
                        The tutorial I followed for this website made various Python and HTML5 files/folders by using
                        the terminal and making directories instead of just doing it the easy way. I found that a much
                        simpler method of doing this was by just doing it all in your IDE(Integrated Development 
                        Environment), like Visual Studio Code. I'm assuming that anyone reading this uses this IDE, 
                        considering it's the one we use at robotics and is among the world's most popular IDEs. If 
                        you do choose to not use Visual Studio Code, just know that most of what I'm saying will apply
                        to any other IDE, or at least shouldn't be too difficult to figure out yourself. If you want to 
                        follow along either: install an IDE such as VSC(<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code Installation</a>) or figure out how to make folders and files within the terminal.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>So, let's get into setting up our first folder and Python file inside of it. Firstly, 
                        you want to open a new window of Visual Studio Code, click "File" -> "Open Folder"
                        <br><br><img src="./img/open folder.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Then, navigate through to your folder called "microblog". If you aren't sure where this folder is, 
                        you can do a search or look at the file path from when you were doing commands in the terminal, as 
                        shown below.
                        <br><br><img src="./img/microblog file path.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Next, you just want to click "Select Folder". Once you have the folder open, you'll notice how the 
                        "venv" folder has already been made inside of your "microblog" folder. It contains all the things
                        you've installed into your virtual environment thus far. Now, you want to make a new folder at the
                        same 'level' as this folder. You do this by clicking on the button shown below to make a new folder 
                        directly inside the "microblog" one - make sure you haven't selected the "venv" folder and are 
                        just in the "microblog" folder. You're going to name this new folder "app". 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/app.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Inside of the new app folder, you're going to make a new file by clicking on this button, and name it
                        "__init__.py". This'll let Visual Studio Code know about which kind of file it is by its file extension. 
                        This is ".py" in our case, which is short for Python. "__init__" signifies it as being the initialization file.
                        <br><br><img src="./img/__init__ creation.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, we finally get to the fun part of making the website - coding it! Feel free to copy the code exactly to
                        follow along. Although, I would highly suggest typing it out yourself to get a feel for actually doing so, 
                        rather than copy-pasting it. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/c1 init code p1.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>The Python script above instantiates the application object from the Flask class. The __name__ variable used as 
                        a parameter to the Flask class is a predefined variable in Python, which is set to the name of the module in which 
                        it's used. Later on, Flask will use the location of this module passed here as a starting point when it 
                        needs to load associated resources such as template files(HTML5 front-end files). We then import "routes" from the 
                        folder we made earlier called "app". In case you were curious, the reason as to why we're importing routes at the bottom, 
                        instead of at the top like usual, is because routes references the app variable created here in this file. You don't need
                        to worry about this too much for now, but just know that this is a little work-around for a common issue with Flask applications,
                        being that they mutually reference each other sometimes and can cause an error by doing so. However, as of now, the routes file 
                        has not yet been created. So, let's do that!
                    </p>
                    <p>Just like how you did it earlier, you're going to be making yet another python file inside of the "app" folder, name 
                        it "routes.py". Once you've done this, type this code into that file.
                        <br><br><img src="./img/routes.jpg"> 
                    </p>
                    <p>This file will be used to make various 'routes' to the URLs for the application, or its different 'pages'/'views'. 
                        The routes are the different URLs that the application implements. With the Flask web framework, handlers for the 
                        application routes are written as Python functions, called view functions. These functions are mapped(like a pointer)
                        to one or more route URLs so that Flask knows what to execute under that URL. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This view function is very simple, all it does when a user accesses this URL(either '/' or '/index') is return "Hello, World!"
                        The two @app.route lines above the function are what's known as decorators. They're not part of the flask framework, rather
                        they're built into Python, meaning you might see them elsewhere in other projects of yours later on. They essentially act
                        like modifiers for the function under them. This decorator take the URL as an argument inside of the brackets and associates 
                        it with the function. This means that when a user accesses either of the two URLs, the function below them will be executed. 
                        Most of the time, though, these functions only require one of these decorators in order to get called. It's just that whether
                        the user is on the default(blank or '/') URL, or on the '/index' URL, we want it to run that same function. 
                    </p>
                    <p>To finally get the application up and running on your browser, there is one more Python script you need to make. It should be 
                        made a top 'level' of all your files inside of microblog. Meaning, it is on the same 'level' as "app" or "venv". You do this 
                        by clicking on the new file button after having clicked on the microblog folder so that you make a file directly inside of
                        this folder. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/microblog.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>This one line of code just imports the application instance from the app package. I know it can be a little confusing with having them 
                        as the same name, but to re-clarify: the first "app" is the variable in which we instantiated the app class object inside of, and the 
                        second "app" is the package class it's getting instantiated from in the app.py file. Feel free to change the variable name or importing 
                        the app package as a different name by doing the following: "import app as (new name for it)" as opposed to simply doing "import app" 
                        at the top of the "__init__.py" file.
                    </p>
                    <p>The last step before running your application on a localhost is setting up the FLASK_APP environment variable. On a windows machine,
                        you need to do this following command:
                        <br><br><img src="./img/set flask_app.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>On other machines, you need to type "export" instead of "set" like so:
                        <br><br><img src="./img/export flask_app.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Get used to running this command in your virtual environment. You're going to have to do it every single time you re-launch your
                        terminal to run this application. Also, if you're running multiple flask applications, you're going to have to make sure you're 
                        in the right flask_app environment. This has caused a lot of frustration in the past for me, when I didn't realize I had actually
                        just been in the wrong flask_app environment. Save yourself the headache and always remember to do this when opening up the terminal 
                        for running your flask application. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, the last thing left to do is run your flask application. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/flask run.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>To access the application that's just been run on your computer, you can type "localhost:5000" into your browser's address bar. 
                        If you remember from earlier, though, we set up 2 different URL decorators to access this same page. This was the first one('/'), 
                        alternatively, you can also type "localhost:5000/index". However, these are the only two URLs you can type in at the moment. 
                        In the terminal, once you're done, you can press Ctrl-C to stop the application from running.
                    </p>
                    <p>Before we leave off this chapter, there's one more thing to mention. If you'll find it tedious to reset the flask_app environment 
                        variable every single time you open up the terminal window, you can setup a file at the top 'level' of your "microblog" folder 
                        that'll be called ".flaskenv". 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/flaskenv.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Then, after doing this you need to type in this command into the terminal:
                        <br><br><img src="./img/pip install python-dotenv.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, to run your flask application again in the future, all you need to do is go into the terminal and follow these steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li>"cd (directory)" into the right directory, which should be "microblog" at the end of the file path you're in</li>
                            <li>activate your virtual environment</li>
                            <li>if you didn't make the .flaskenv file and haven't automatically set your flask environment varibale, do so 
                                by typing in the proper command(either "set" or "export" FLASK_APP=microblog.py)</li>
                            <li>type "flask run" into your terminal</li>
                            <li>visit the "localhost:5000" address in your browser</li>
                            <li>press Ctrl-C to stop deployment</li>
                        </ol>

                    <br><br><br><h2><a name="chapter2">Chapter 2: Templates</a></h2>

                    <h3><u>Introduction To Templates</u></h3>
                    <p>Since, we don't yet have users on our webpage, we don't have to worry about that yet, instead, we can make mock ones.
                        We're going to be implementing these as Python dictionaries, linking a user's username to their username. In our case, 
                        we'll name our first mock user "Bogar". Having mock objects or components to your website is a really useful thing in 
                        web development. It allows you to concentrate on one part of the application without having to worry about the other
                        parts of the system that don't exist yet, while still being able to test it out like it were implemented already. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Right now, we want to create our homepage that'll display a custom message based on our user's username being "Bogar". 
                        The first step to that is to set a mock username to the variable "user".
                        <br><br><img src="./img/making bogar user.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, though, we need to return something from this view function and display it on the website. We'll do this by having 
                        an HTML5 file. To make this file, we first need to make a new folder called "templates" inside the "app" folder. Then, 
                        inside of the new "templates" folder, make a new file called "index.html". This is the standard name among various HTML 
                        applications to indicate the main page of a website. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/index html creation.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, we need to give it a title to have displayed in the tab bar and our message inside of the body. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/index code.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a pretty basic HTML page, other than the {{...}} symbols. These represent placeholders for dynamic content, like variables. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, we need to head back to the routes.py file and return something in the index view function. For this, we'll be importing 
                        a function from flask called "render_template". This function takes a template filename('index.html') and a variable list of 
                        template arguments in our placeholders and returns the template, now with actual values instead of placeholders for those values. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/importing render template.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>You can now, of course, try this in your browser once again, to see how the content got modified. </p>

                    <h3><u>User Posts</u></h3>
                    <p>Once again, we're going to make use of mock users and also some new mock posts to display users and their posts on the home page. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/regular adding posts.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>I know that this can seem pretty complex, but I'll try explaining these different data types and colour-coding parts of it in the image. 
                        To represent user posts we'll be using a list. Inside this list, there'll be two dictionaries with "author" and "body" fields.
                        The first post dictionary's first item's "author" field has a dictionary as its value, and in this dictionary, lies the key('username') along 
                        with the value('Daniel'). 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/adding posts.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>Now, we have to update the index template. Since, the list of posts can have any number of elements, 
                        it's up to the view function to decide how many posts are going to be presented in the page. The template cannot 
                        make any assumptions about how many posts there are, so it needs to be prepared to render as many posts as the view sends. 
                        We can do this by making a simple for loop that iterates through the posts and, for each post, has the post author's username 
                        and its post body to put in a paragraph tag. The little conditional I put in the head tag is pretty simple to understand. It
                        just evaluates whether there's already a title for this page, and either uses it in the title before "- Microblog" or generates 
                        the generic title of "Welcome to Microblog". 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/new index.jpg">
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3><u>Template Inheritance</u></h3>
                    <p>Just like this website you're currently on, many have navigation bars at the top of their pages, with a few links. The links 
                        on this website are: "HOME", "WRITE-UP", and "ABOUT RAVENSCOUT". This isn't very hard to do normally by just copy-pasting the 
                        same links into every single file, but there's a simpler way to do this in HTML5. For good practice, we want to avoid repetition 
                        at all costs in programming if it's more efficient.
                    </p>
                    <p>Jinga2, which is included in Flask, has a template inheritance feature that helps us with avoiding repetition in our HTML files. 
                        It essentially allowed you to make one 'base' file, which we'll call "base.html" that'll have all parts of the page layout that 
                        are common to all templates, from which other templates are derived from. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Let's go ahead and make this file in the templates folder and call it "base.html". It'll include a simple navigation bar and the 
                        title conditional logic implemented earlier into the index.html file. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/base html.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>In this main template, the block control statement(anything inside of {...}) is there to define the place where the derived 
                        templates can insert themselves into this one. Blocks are given a unique name, which derived templates can reference when they 
                        provide their proper content. Now, we can adapt the index.html file to now inherit from this base template we've just made. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/new index inheritance.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>The base.html template file will now be taking care of all the general page structure parts, so all that's required in the 
                        index.html file is its proper content for that page. The "extends" control statement establishes the inheritance link between the 
                        two template files. In more complicated terms, this means that Jinja2 know that when it is asked to render index.html it needs to 
                        embed it inside base.html. Two two templates have matching block statements named "content", and this is how Jinja2 knows how to 
                        combine the two templates into one. Now, for any additional pages, this base.html template has you covered and will just need to be 
                        extended once again, in the same manner. This is how we can achieve the same look and feel of two web sub-pages without the need for duplication. 
                    </p>

                    <br><br><br><h2><a name="chapter2">Chapter 3: Web Forms</a></h2>

                    <h3><u>Introduction To Flask-WTF</u></h3>
                    <p>We are now going to be addressing our little issue of only having mock users. This will be done through the use 
                        of web forms by accepting input to store actual users. Web forms are key in most web applications, being one 
                        of the most basic building blocks to making a great web application. We'll be using forms to allow users to submit 
                        posts, and also for logging in to the application. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This is where the Flask-WTF extension will come in handy. There will also be many more flask extensions to come 
                        in the future. Once again, you can install this into your virtual environment by using the command seen below, like you've done previously. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/pip install flask-wtf.jpg">
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3><u>Configuration</u></h3>
                    <p>The application we've made so far is very simple, and for that reason we don't need to worry about its 
                        configuration. However, in many cases with web apps, you might find yourself wanting to configure some variables 
                        that'll get passed to the Flask web framework to personalize your website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>There's several formats for the application to specify configuration options. The format we're going to be using 
                        is to store configuration variables in a class. This file named "config.py" will be made inside of the "app" folder. 
                        <br><br><img src="./img/config py.jpg">
                    </p>
                    <p>If we eventually get to need more than one configuration set, then there is an option to make subclasses of this 
                        configuration class. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The SECRET_KEY configuration variable is used as a value for a cryptographic key. Flask uses this to prevent 
                        a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack or CSRF. The value of this secret key is set as an expression with two 
                        terms, joined by the or operator. The first term looks for the value of an environment variable, also called
                        SECRET_KEY
