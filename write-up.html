                    <p>Firstly, you need to ensure that Python is installed onto your machine.
                        This can be done by visiting the <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a> website.
                        Make sure to have it be at least Python3.6 or later, since older versions
                        aren't supported by Flask. Also, make sure that you select "add to PATH" upon 
                        installation. By installing Python, you also get pip, which will allow you to 
                        install modules/libraries directly from whatever terminal window you're using.
                        You can also use your terminal window to check if python is installed by typing 
                        in "python3" or "python" if that doesn't work. This'll display your current version
                        and enter you into the Python Interpreter, which will be used later for various
                        python commands, so remember how to access it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once Python is installed, along with pip, you can then use this command to install packages(like Flask).

                    </p>
                    <p>If you're having issues with running this command, check to see if you are on 
                        the administrative user's account, since it won't work on another user's account.
                    </p>
