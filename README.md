# Robotics-Summative

- in the RavenScout one, I'll talk about:
    1. general info
    2. requirements/goals of the website
    3. contributors
    4. Sayf's plan for the website, in terms of where it's headed in the future
    5. Include the repository for RavenScout https://github.com/FusionStreak/RavenScout
- ask Sayf to make a little visualization of what the finished product of RavenScout would look like
