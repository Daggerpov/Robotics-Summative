    3. contributors
    4. Sayf's plan for the website, in terms of where it's headed in the future
    5. Include the repository for RavenScout https://github.com/FusionStreak/RavenScout
- ask Sayf to make a little visualization of what the finished product of RavenScout would look like
- profiles for each team, based on data received
- data visualizer
- insert photo
- contributors: Sayfullah, Daniel, and Hassan
- it's just supposed to store data from each year
- uploading csv files
- initially, it'll just be certain teams with personalized logins for trusted users
- cross-referencing validation from bluealliance once it's uploaded, remember that it takes a while for the data on blue alliance
- additional mobile app for RavenScout
