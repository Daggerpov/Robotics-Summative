# Robotics-Summative

- make three routes: Home, Write-Up, About RavenScout
- in the RavenScout one, I'll talk about:
    1. general info
    2. requirements/goals of the website
    3. contributors
    4. Sayf's plan for the website
    5. Include the repository for RavenScout https://github.com/FusionStreak/RavenScout
- I need to make the write-up file smaller, by including individual files for each chapter into the main write-up file
- I need to email Mr. Morrison to get confirmation that the way I'm doing things in chapter 1 are good
- reorganize the images and crop them better, like the vsc ones and command prompt ones, as well
