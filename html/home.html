                <h1>Daniel Agapov's Robotics Summative Website</h1>
                <p>This is how I'll be presenting my robotics summative write-up for the 2020 First Robotics Competition season. In the form of this website I've made using basic HTML and CSS.</p>

                <p>From the start of the season until around the end of February, Hassan Ali and I had been 
                    working on the robot's drivetrain code together. Then, as Sayfullah Eid started working on 
                    a website to automate scouting for FRC, I decided to join in on that. Since, we did not have 
                    a set due date or needed it to be completed for a certain competition this year, I had time 
                    to properly start learning about web development. So, Sayf decided it was best to just have 
                    me learn about the tools he was planning to use for building this website, which, as of right 
                    now, is to be called "RavenScout". The tools being:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flask</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                    <li>HTML5</li>
                    <li>a bit of CSS3</li>
                    <li>a bit of JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
                <p>On top of just learning the different tools he wanted me to use for the website, it also required
                    me to learn about databases and other programming concepts. All of this information was found in
                    the guide he sent, which you can find here: <a href="https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world">The Flask Mega-Tutorial</a>
                </p>
                <p>I found this assignment challenging and very useful towards my software engineering career. It allowed
                    me to explore different areas of software engineering/development that opened my eyes to new opportunities 
                    and technologies. Previously, I found myself to only be interested in back-end development. However,
                    after learning about building the front-end of websites, I discovered that it could also be interesting for me.
